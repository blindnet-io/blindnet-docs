# How Privacy Computation Engine Works

## Configuring your Privacy Computation Engine

You must first configure the Privacy Computation Engine in order to make the most of it.
It needs to know about:
- General information about your Organization and its' data processing policies (Equivalent to a RoPA - Record of Processing Activities)
- Mappings of your data structures to [PRIV](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md) Data Categories
- Few choices you have to make about when to authenticate the user (before or after they make a Privacy Request), and when to deliver automatic responses and when to wait for validation

To Configure your Privacy Computation Engine prepare the following information:
| Information | Format | Example|
| :----: | :-----: | :--------|
| Name and contact details of your Organization and its representative | `string` | `Blindnet Inc. hello@blindnet.io Vuk Janosevic`|
| Identity and contact of a Data Protection Officer - if you are using blindnet devkit Privacy Request Builder, include the URL where you are hosting the interface | `string` | `Vuk Janosevic, www.blindnet.io/privacy-request-builder`|
| If you are processing data on behalf of someone else (a Controller), then names, contact details of all such Controllers their representatives and the data protection officers | `string` | see above |
| A link to your Privacy Policy | `URL` | `https://blindnet.io/privacy` |
| A general description of the technical and organisational security measures referred to in Article 32 of GDPR | `string` | `We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your personal data, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the processing, and the threats posed.`|
| Countries where data servers are located (included those of the processors who are processing data on your behalf) | `string` | `France` |
| A table of data categories, purposes, legal bases, ... | `Processing Record` | see bellow |
| A table of data partners in data transfers, and data categories concerned | `Transfer Record` | see bellow |
| A list of retention policies | [Retention Policies](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#retention-policy) | `data-categories`:`CONTACT`; `policy-type`:`NO-LONGER-THAN`, `duration`: `180 days`, `after`: `RELATIONSHIP-END` |

## Using your Privacy Computation Engine

The Privacy Computation Engine (PCE) processes a timeline of [PRIV Events](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#events).
Feed anything that is a PRIV event (e.g. Consent, Legal Base Event, Privacy Request) to your PCE.
The PCE will order them in a timeline.

Processing the timeline of PRIV events, the PCE will deliver recommendations of [Privacy Request Responses](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#privacy-request-response)

The PCE decides on the responses to recommend by calculating, at each moment an Eligible Privacy Scope.
The component responsible for translating PRIV events into operations over the Eligible Privacy Scope is called Privacy Compiler.
See [How Privacy Compiler Works](./pc.mdx) to learn more.
