# How Privacy Computation Engine Works

## Configuring your Privacy Computation Engine

You must first configure the Privacy Computation Engine in order to make the most of it.
It needs to know about:
- General information about your Organization and its' data processing policies (Equivalent to a RoPA - Record of Processing Activities)
- Mappings of your data structures to [PRIV](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md) Data Categories
- Few choices you have to make about when to authenticate the user (before or after they make a Privacy Request), and when to deliver automatic responses and when to wait for validation

**TBD** - specify the format in which this is submitted


## Using your Privacy Computation Engine

The Privacy Computation Engine (PCE) processes a timeline of [PRIV Events](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#events).
Feed anything that is a PRIV event (e.g. Consent, Legal Base Event, Privacy Request) to your PCE.
The PCE will order them in a timeline.

Processing the timeline of PRIV events, the PCE will deliver recommendations of [Privacy Request Responses](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#privacy-request-response)

The PCE decides on the responses to recommend by calculating, at each moment an Eligible Privacy Scope.
The component responsible for translating PRIV events into operations over the Eligible Privacy Scope is called Privacy Compiler.
See [How Privacy Compiler Works](./pc.mdx) to learn more.
