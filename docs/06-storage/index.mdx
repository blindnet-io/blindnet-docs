While handling Privacy Requests, the Pricacy Computation Engines can be connected with storage services to automatically interpret and execute data deletions and modifications.

Two components of the devkit are here to help you integrate this easily, either as a new service or as part of your pre-existing architure:

- a [Data Access Component](./data-access) transforming requests from a [Privacy Computation Engine](/docs/computation) to efficiently execute operations on data stored on an external storage service
- [Storage Connector](./connection) libraries you can use to connect your existing storage service with a Data Access Component
