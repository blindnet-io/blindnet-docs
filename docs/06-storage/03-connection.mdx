The [Data Access Component](./data-access) can directly interact with any storage service.

blindnet provides ready-to-use efficient services to store [captured data](/docs/data-capture) so you don't have to worry about implementing dedicated secured storage yourself if you don't need to.

You can still easily connect to your pre-existing storage service using our Storage Connector helper libraries.

Storage Connector libraries are available for the following platforms:

- [Java](https://github.com/blindnet-io/storage-connector-java/)
- _and more soon..._
