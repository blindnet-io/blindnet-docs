Blindnet offers a simple solution to enable data privacy and compliance with requirements in various data regulations, including GDPR and CCPA.

Beyond compliance, we provide software developers with a service to minimize the exposure to unnecessary user data and reduce the risk in case of data breaches, via two complementary solutions:

1. **blindnet devkit**, offering end-to-end encryption in your web applications ;
2. our **Privacy Stack**, an infrastucture built for secured synchronous and asynchronous data transfers on top of the blindnet devkit.

## blindnet devkit

The blindnet devkit gives all developers the hability to protect usersâ€™ data (e.g., files, images, documents) in an easy and intuitive way.

It is compatible with all available user authentication systems. The user experience does not change when you integrate the blindnet devkit.


### What it does

When using the blindnet devkit in your application, the JavaScript client library encrypts and decrypts user data directly on user local machines (e.g, browsers or mobile phones), while managing the encryption keys in the background, along with:

- Symmetric encryption of documents (e.g., files, images); document keys are randomly generated and transferred between users with asymmetric key encryption.
- A password-based secure backup of user private keys, which allows users to access their data from different browsers. Thanks to our password splitting function your users still use only one password to access your system and to secure their private keys.
- Data exchange between registered users of your application, and from unregistered to registered users.
- End-to-end encryption: no one except senders and intended recipients can read the data.
