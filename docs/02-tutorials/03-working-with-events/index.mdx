# DevKit - Working with events

In order to evaluate complex situations, the Privacy Computation Engine (PCE) must know about key events concerning a user.
When the user gives consent, or subscribes to a service, or cancels subscription the PCE add information to a user-specific timeline.
Thanks to this timeline, the PCE knows what to do when the user makes a request to `REVOKE-CONSENT`, `OBJECT` to processing of their data, or `RESTRICT` the processing.

In this section you will see how to let blindnet devkit know about those key events.

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items} />
