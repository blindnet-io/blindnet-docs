A [Data Access Component](/docs/storage/data-access) is here to transform requests from the [Privacy Computation Engine](/docs/computation) to efficiently execute automated operations on your data storage.

You can choose to use the [Capture Component](/docs/data-capture) and directly store the captured data in blindnet's preconfigured storage, or your own storage service.

You can also directly connect the Data Access Component to your own storage service without using the Capture Component. For see sake of simplicity, we'll choose this option for this tutorial.

For that, we'll set up a dedicated demo storage service in Java, and connect it to the Capture Component using the [Java Storage Connector library](https://github.com/blindnet-io/storage-connector-java).

:::tip

Code for this demo stage service can be found in the `example` directory in the librarie's repository: [github.com/blindnet-io/storage-connector-java > `example`](https://github.com/blindnet-io/storage-connector-java/tree/develop/example).

## Running the Data Access Component Locally

```bash
git clone git@github.com:blindnet-io/data-access-component.git
sbt assembly
docker build -t blindnet/dac .
docker run -it blindnet/dac
```

## Storage Connector demo

```bash
mvn package
cd example/
docker build -t blindnet/connector-demo
docker run -e BN_CONNECTOR_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8028 -it blindnet/connector-demo
