Now, the Data Consumer Interface has been correctly added to your web page, so let's open it to better see how to use it.

By default, the DCI component will open on a "pending requests" screen, listing all the privacy requests your organization should handle.

Each Privacy Request can be expanded to reveal the interface allowing you to answer the request:

Here, you can either accept ("Grant") or reject ("Deny") the request, with an optional message to be sent to the user if necessary.

You can notice here the DCI directly provides recommendations based on the configuration of your system.

Once you selected the right response and optionally added a message, click the submit button to send your response.
