User interfaces for the blindnet devkit (aka _[Privacy Components for the Web](https://github.com/blindnet-io/privacy-components-web)_) are delivered as standard [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction) available on both npm and a CDN.

As a consequence, installing the blindnet devkit web interfaces doesn't involve any specificity, as you can install and use them as you would with any other standard Web Component.

:::info

See [Using Web Components](/docs/interfaces/install/using-web-components) for more information on how to integrate Web Components in your existing project.

:::

In the interest of simplicity and clarity, let's see how to integrate these components into a simple static HTML page, starting with the Privacy Request Capture Interface (PRCI).

PRCI is a simple interface allowing your users to assert their privacy rights by sending you a simple yet standardized [Privacy Request](/docs/references/lexicon#privacy-request). It is an entry point for your user to privacy, not only allowing you to cover GDPR and other privacy-related legislations but also and more importantly, to build trust by showing your users their privacy rights are tangibly handled, enforced and respected.

To integrate this interface into your web page, you'll first need to load the associated bundle (included in the `@blindnet/prci` npm package) from the unpkg CDN by adding a `<script>` tag to your HTML document:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@blindnet/prci/dist/index.core.min.js?module" type="module"></script>
```

:::info

Here, we use the `core` module build for performance improvement.

As this build only integrates the _core_ parts of the library, external dependencies like [Lit](https://lit.dev) will only be loaded once, even after we add other privacy components to this same web page.

Your specific context might be different. This is why each Privacy Component for the Web includes different builds and bundles covering any specific needs, as detailed in the [User Interfaces - Install](/docs/interfaces/install) section.

:::

Then, you only need to add the associated entry-point custom element `<bln-priv-request>` to your HTML document:

```html
<h2 id="priv-request">Make a privacy request</h2>

<bldn-priv-request></bldn-priv-request>
```

The `bldn-priv-request` custom element support several attributes and properties to interact with it and configure its behavior.

Here, we only need to use the `computation-base-url` attribute to tell it to use our local PCE instance instead of the central one.

```html
<bldn-priv-request computation-base-url="http://localhost:9000/v0"></bldn-priv-request>
```

Leading us to the following HTML file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-GB">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Privacy Components for the Web - Minimal Static Demo</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Privacy Components for the Web - Minimal Static Demo</h1>

    <h2>Assert Your Privacy Rights</h2>

    <bldn-priv-request computation-base-url="http://localhost:9000/v0"></bldn-priv-request>

    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@blindnet/prci/dist/index.core.min.js?module" type="module"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

:::info Demo

This simple static demo can be tested live on [blindnet-io.github.io](https://blindnet-io.github.io/privacy-components-web/demos/static/).

Code can be found in the [privacy-components-web repository](https://github.com/blindnet-io/privacy-components-web/tree/main/demos/static).

## Check Out our Demo Web App

Need to see a more advanced use case? We got you covered.

:::tip Check it out

See our Demo Web App in action on [blindnet-io.github.io](https://blindnet-io.github.io/privacy-components-web/demos/devkit-simple-tutorial/) and read its code in the [privacy-components-web repository](https://github.com/blindnet-io/privacy-components-web/tree/main/demos/devkit-simple-tutorial).

:::

We keep this project as minimalist as possible for the sake of simplicity. It only use [lit](https://lit.dev/), with [Carbon Web Components](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/) and the [Vaadin Router](https://hilla.dev/docs/routing/router). The build system has been set up using the [Open WC generator](https://open-wc.org/guides/developing-components/getting-started/) (refer to the README for more information).

You can either directly clone the whole monorepo locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:blindnet-io/privacy-components-web.git
cd privacy-components-web/demos/devkit-simple-tutorial/
```

or use [git sparse-checkout](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-sparse-checkout) to only download the project itself:

```bash
mkdir devkit-web-demo
cd devkit-web-demo
git init
git remote add -f origin git@github.com:blindnet-io/privacy-components-web.git
git config core.sparsecheckout true
echo "demos/devkit-simple-tutorial" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
git pull origin main
```

Then, you'll need to install the project's dependencies using classic yarn (v1) or npm:

```bash
yarn install
# OR
npm install
```

Then, start the development server:

```bash
yarn start
# OR
npm start
```

and open the application in your browser using the given URL.

The next steps have been already developed in this demo project. You can therefore refer to it whenever in doubt.
