You can configure the Application's privacy settings in the [dashboard](https://stage.dashboard.blindnet.io/).  

From the list of applications, open the one you wish to configure and select the **Privacy Configuration** tab.

:::note
While there are multiple configuration units, in this tutorial we will configure the **General information**, **Request resolution strategy** and **Legal bases**.
:::

### Configure General information

:::info
User's can retrieve application's general information when making `TRANSPARENCY` requests.
:::

Click on the **General information** item and fill out the form. Make sure to include all the details as specified [here](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#storing-general-information). Save the changes.  

### Configure Request resolution strategy

:::info
Most of the request types can be automated using the blindnet devkit. To illustrate this, we will make the devkit respond to `TRANSPARENCY` requests automatically.  
:::

Click on the **Request resolution strategy** item and change the value of the **Transparency** field to `automatic`. Save the changes.

### Configure Legal bases

:::note
We will configure a `CONSENT` legal base that covers *using user's email address for advertising purposes*. Later in the tutorial, a user will "give" their consent using the created consent's `ID`.
:::

Click on the **Legal bases** tab and then on the **New legal base** button.  
Give it the **Name** and select `CONSENT` as it's **Type**.

From the **Data categories** list, select `CONTACT.EMAIL`  
From the **Processing categories** list, select `USING`  
From the **Processing purposes** list, select `ADVERTISING`  

:::note
You can select multiple values by holding the `CTRL` key.
:::

Hit the **Save** button.

> A new legal base is now created.

From the list of legal bases, click on the `CONSENT` you just created and make a note of it's `ID`. You'll use it later in this tutorial.

:::tip Checkpoint

We have created and configured a devkit application. In the next steps, you'll learn how use it with the real world use-case.
