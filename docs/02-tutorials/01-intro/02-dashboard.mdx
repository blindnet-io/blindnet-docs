Devkit applications are managed using the **blindnet Dashboard**, found on [stage.dashboard.blindnet.io](https://stage.dashboard.blindnet.io).

:::info
In order to automate privacy requests, you need to have an active devkit application.  
:::

## Step 1: Register

Head over to the [registration page](https://stage.dashboard.blindnet.io/register) and create an account.
You'll get an email message to verify your email address.

## Step 2: Create an Application group

After you verify your account, first, you need to create an **application group**.

:::info
An **Application group** is a container for your devkit applications. Applications in the same group share the same authentication key but their settings and scopes are independent.  
Usually, all of your applications will be in a single group.
:::

Specify your group's **name** and **key**.

:::note
The key is generated locally (in the browser window) but you can provide your own.  
Make sure to `copy` and `save` the **key** as blindnet does not store it. If you lose the **key**, a new one has to be generated.
:::

## Step 3: Create an Application

Click on the `New App` button to create an **Application**.  
After the **Application** is created, open it from the list of applications and you'll find it's `ID`.

Now, you should have the Groups's `key` and Application's `ID`. We will use them in the later steps of the tutorial to authenticate the users.
