User interfaces for the blindnet devkit (aka _[Privacy Components for the Web](https://github.com/blindnet-io/privacy-components-web)_) are delivered as standard [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction) available both on NPM and through a CDN.

:::info

See [Using Web Components](/docs/interfaces/install/using-web-components) for more information on how to integrate Web Components in your existing project.

:::

The first component we'll use is the Privacy Request Capture Interface (PRCI), an entry point for submitting and viewing [Privacy Requests](/docs/references/lexicon#privacy-request).

For this section of the tutorial, we will start with the simple static frontend available [here](https://github.com/blindnet-io/devkit-quickstart/blob/main/web/intro-start.html) and modify the `<body>` content.

## Load the Bundle

First we'll load the PRCI bundle (included in the [`@blindnet/prci`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blindnet/prci) npm package) from the [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) CDN:

```html
<body>
  <h1>Privacy Request Portal</h1>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@blindnet/prci@latest/dist/index.all.min.js" type="module"></script>
</body>
```

<!--
:::info

Here, we use the `core` module build for performance improvement.

As this build only integrates the _core_ parts of the library, external dependencies like [Lit](https://lit.dev) will only be loaded once, even after we add other privacy components to this same web page.

Your specific context might be different. This is why each Privacy Component for the Web includes different builds and bundles covering any specific needs, as detailed in the [User Interfaces - Install](/docs/interfaces/install) section.

:::
-->

## Add the Interface

Now, let's expose the `<bldn-priv-request>` custom element:

```html
<body>
  <h1>Privacy Request Portal</h1>
  <bldn-priv-request></bldn-priv-request>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@blindnet/prci@latest/dist/index.all.min.js" type="module"></script>
</body>
```

:::tip Checkpoint
The HTML file with our changes thus far can be found [here](https://github.com/blindnet-io/devkit-quickstart/blob/main/web/expose-request-interface.html). You should now see a PRCI component which can be used to build requests. Once completed, the component will fire an [event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events) containing the JSON representation of the request.

See [**PRCI Events**](/docs/Interfaces/PRCI/Events) for more details on capturing this event.
:::

Next, let's set up the [Privacy Computation Engine](./pce-set-up).

<!--
The `bldn-priv-request` custom element supports several attributes and properties to interact with it and configure its behavior.

Here, we only need to use the `computation-base-url` attribute to tell it to use our local PCE instance instead of the central one.

```html
<bldn-priv-request computation-base-url="http://localhost:9000/v0"></bldn-priv-request>
```

:::info Demo

This simple static demo can be tested live on [blindnet-io.github.io](https://blindnet-io.github.io/privacy-components-web/demos/static/).

Code can be found in the [privacy-components-web repository](https://github.com/blindnet-io/privacy-components-web/tree/main/demos/static).

:::

## Check Out our Demo Web App

Need to see a more advanced use case? We got you covered.

:::tip Check it out

See our Demo Web App in action on [blindnet-io.github.io](https://blindnet-io.github.io/privacy-components-web/demos/devkit-simple-tutorial/) and read its code in the [privacy-components-web repository](https://github.com/blindnet-io/privacy-components-web/tree/main/demos/devkit-simple-tutorial).

:::

We keep this project as minimalist as possible for the sake of simplicity. It only uses [lit](https://lit.dev/), with [Carbon Web Components](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/) and the [Vaadin Router](https://hilla.dev/docs/routing/router). The build system has been set up using the [Open WC generator](https://open-wc.org/guides/developing-components/getting-started/) (refer to the README for more information).

You can either directly clone the whole monorepo locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:blindnet-io/privacy-components-web.git
cd privacy-components-web/demos/devkit-simple-tutorial/
```

or use [git sparse-checkout](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-sparse-checkout) to only download the project itself:

```bash
mkdir devkit-web-demo
cd devkit-web-demo
git init
git remote add -f origin git@github.com:blindnet-io/privacy-components-web.git
git config core.sparsecheckout true
echo "demos/devkit-simple-tutorial" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
git pull origin main
```

Then, you'll need to install the project's dependencies using classic yarn (v1) or npm:

```bash
yarn install
# OR
npm install
```

Then, start the development server:

```bash
yarn start
# OR
npm start
```

and open the application in your browser using the given URL.

The next steps have been already developed in this demo project. You can therefore refer to it whenever in doubt.
