User interfaces for the blindnet devkit (aka _[Blindnet web modules](https://github.com/blindnet-io/privacy-components-web)_) are delivered as standard [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction) available both on NPM and through a CDN.

:::info

See [Using Web Components](/docs/interfaces/install/using-web-components) for more information on how to integrate Web Components in your existing project.

:::

The first component we'll use is the [Privacy Portal](/docs/interfaces/privacy-portal), an entry point for submitting and viewing [Privacy Requests](/docs/references/lexicon#privacy-request).

For this section of the tutorial, we will start with the simple static frontend available [here](https://github.com/blindnet-io/devkit-quickstart/blob/main/tutorials/intro/web/0-intro-start.html).

## Load the Bundle

First we'll load the Privacy Portal bundle (included in the [`@blindnet/privacy-portal`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blindnet/privacy-portal) npm package) from the [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) CDN:

```html
<head>
  ...
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@blindnet/privacy-portal@latest/dist/index.all.min.js" type="module"></script>
  ...
</head>
```

<!--
:::info

Here, we use the `core` module build for performance improvement.

As this build only integrates the _core_ parts of the library, external dependencies like [Lit](https://lit.dev) will only be loaded once, even after we add other privacy components to this same web page.

Your specific context might be different. This is why each Privacy Component for the Web includes different builds and bundles covering any specific needs, as detailed in the [User Interfaces - Install](/docs/interfaces/install) section.

## Add the Interface

Now, let's expose the `<bldn-privacy-portal>` custom element:

```html
<body>
  <h1>Privacy Request Portal</h1>
  <bldn-privacy-portal id="devkit"></bldn-privacy-portal>
</body>
```

At this point you should see the request interface, which you can use to build your first Privacy Request.

## Listen for Requests

After we build our request and click submit, the Privacy Portal will fire an [event](/docs/interfaces/privacy-portal/events) containing the JSON representation of the request.

You can catch this event in your application by adding an [event listener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener):

```html
<body>
  <h1>Privacy Request Portal</h1>
  <bldn-privacy-portal id="devkit"></bldn-privacy-portal>
  <script>
    /**
      * Log the request within the event emitted by the Privacy Portal
      * @param e {CustomEvent}
      */
    function catchRequest(e) {
      
      // Stop the request from bubbling further
      e.stopPropagation()

      // Extract the request object
      const { request } = e.detail

      // Log the request
      console.log(request)
    }

    // Add listener to the Privacy Portal element
    document.getElementById("devkit").addEventListener("bldn-request-builder:request-created", catchRequest)
  </script>
</body>
```

:::tip Checkpoint

We can now build a privacy request and capture the emitted request object.

The HTML file with our work so far can be found [here](https://github.com/blindnet-io/devkit-quickstart/blob/main/tutorials/intro/web/1-expose-request-interface-event-listener.html).

Next, let's [create a devkit application](./dashboard).
