import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'

Now, let's test it out! Open the [static page](https://github.com/blindnet-io/devkit-quickstart/blob/main/tutorials/intro/web/3-handle-consent.html) we just created.

## Identify Yourself

Enter your email and hit submit to get a blindnet token and enable the interface.

:::note

In this tutorial we disable the Privacy Portal until a token is passed to illustrate the use of the [Privacy Portal](/docs/interfaces/privacy-portal) in combination with the devkit Application. It is also possible to use the Privacy Portal by itself, as we do in [part one](./privacy-portal-set-up).

## Build the Request

First, select an [action](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#actions) which describes the purpose of our request. See [here](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/dictionary/actions/en.actions.json) for a description of all possible actions.

Select **Transparency** to build a request about data processing information and practices.
