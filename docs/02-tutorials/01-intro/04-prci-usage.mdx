Now, open the demo web app or static page in your browser to see this component in action:

Here, your users can directly choose from a wide range of privacy request types.

This includes the classical consultation (access), deletion and modification of their data, of course, but also more advanced operations, including but not limited to:

- requesting the portability of their data to a compatible system
- advanced management of their consents (by objecting to and restricting proceeding of their data, or revoking previously given consents)
- and retrieving more generic privacy-related information regarding your organization (via the "transparency" request type).

:::note

These are just requests. **You** determine how those are handled and answered, manually or automatically.

If, for example, your users want to make an `Access` request, and click on the `Access` button, they will be able to ask you to give them access to all the data you have on them, or to only select a subset of it.

Depending on your configuration, two scenarios can then happen.

If like in this example, you set up everything to automatically treat the request, then your users will directly see their request granted (or rejected, depending on the parameters you defined).

Other scenarios might however require to be manually handled.
In this case, your users will see their request is "pending" (i.e. waiting to be handled by your organization).

In this demo, you can see this happen when sending a `delete` request:
