import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'

Now, let's test it out! Open the [static page](https://github.com/blindnet-io/devkit-quickstart/blob/main/web/add-authentication.html) we just created and ensure the PCE we set up is still running.

## Identify Yourself

Enter your email and hit submit to get a blindnet token and enable the interface.

<ReactPlayer playing loop muted url='/video/identify-yourself.mkv'/>

:::note

In this tutorial we disable the PRCI until a token is passed to illustrate the use of the [PRCI](/docs/interfaces/prci) in combination with the PCE. It is also possible to use the PRCI by itself, as we do in [part one](./prci-set-up). 

:::

## Build the Request

First, select an [action](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#actions) which describes the purpose of our request. See [here](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/dictionary/actions/en.actions.json) for a description of all possible actions.

Select **Transparency** to build a request about data processing information and practices.

## View the Response

After submitting the request, view the response containing the requested information.

<ReactPlayer playing loop muted url='/video/view-response.mkv'/>

:::info **PCE Configuration**

In this example, two elements of PCE configuration came into play:

1. [**Automatic vs. Manual Processing**](/docs/computation/configuration#demand-resolution-strategy): You can configure the PCE to respond automatically (or not) for each request type

2. [**General Information**](/docs/computation/configuration#general-information): Certain requests, such as the one we just made for information on the Data Protection Office (DPO), will return the same data no matter who makes the request. You can configure this information.

:::

Next, we will see the interface for processing requests from your users.

<!--

Now, open the demo web app or static page in your browser to see this component in action:

![first screen of the PRCI component](/img/captures/prci-entry.png)

Here, your users can directly choose from a wide range of privacy request types.

This includes the classical consultation (access), deletion and modification of their data, of course, but also more advanced operations, including but not limited to:

- requesting the portability of their data to a compatible system
- advanced management of their consents (by objecting to and restricting proceeding of their data, or revoking previously given consents)
- and retrieving more generic privacy-related information regarding your organization (via the "transparency" request type).

:::note

These are just requests. **You** determine how those are handled and answered, manually or automatically.

:::

If, for example, your users want to make an `Access` request, and click on the `Access` button, they will be able to ask you to give them access to all the data you have on them, or to only select a subset of it.

![First screen for an Access Request in the PRCI component](/img/captures/prci-access-01.png)
![Second screen for an Access Request in the PRCI component](/img/captures/prci-access-02.png)

Depending on your configuration, two scenarios can then happen.

If like in this example, you set up everything to automatically treat the request, then your users will directly see their request granted (or rejected, depending on the parameters you defined).

Other scenarios might however require to be manually handled.
In this case, your users will see their request is "pending" (i.e. waiting to be handled by your organization).

In this demo, you can see this happen when sending a `delete` request:
