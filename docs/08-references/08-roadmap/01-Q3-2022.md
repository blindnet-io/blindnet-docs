## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to give blindnet's clients and partners the visibility about what features can be expected when.

## Product Definition

[blindnet devkit](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/lexicon/RFC-Lexicon-2.md#blindnet-devkit) is a set of software components for implementing [privacy-enabled connectedness](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/notion-of-privacy/notion-of-privacy.md#privacy-enabled-connectedness).

[Organizations](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/lexicon/RFC-Lexicon-2.md#organization) use _blindnet devkit_ to build [Trust](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/notion-of-privacy/notion-of-privacy.md#privacy-is-strongly-linked-with-trust) among their Users, by allowing them to regulate [Privacy](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/notion-of-privacy/notion-of-privacy.md#definition) in the relationship they have with the Organization.

## Product Vision

[blindnet devkit](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/lexicon/RFC-Lexicon-2.md#blindnet-devkit) is the _lingua franca_ for [privacy](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/notion-of-privacy/notion-of-privacy.md#definition) on the Web.

## Product Features

Through its components, blindnet devkit offers:

- **Complete Privacy Feature-set**: acts upon the 3 pillars of privacy in software systems [Confidentiality, Control, and Transparency](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/notion-of-privacy/principles/RFC-SPEP.md):
  - **Confidentiality** (delivered by **(Distributed) Encryption Engine**):
    - e2ee - encrypt and decrypt data locally using SDKs and Web Components
    - Manage encryption in the context of multiple systems exchanging data
    - Support user in lost-access situations
    - Compatibility with 3rd-party identity providers
  - **Restitute Control to Data Subjects** (delivered by _Privacy Request Capture Interface_ of the **Privacy Request Manager**):
    - User-friendly interface for making Privacy Requests
    - Privacy Request transfer: Make a request once - reach all corresponding systems having your data
  - **Transparency** (delivered by Data Subject-facing Web Components of the **Metadata Engine** and by _Privacy Request Capture Interface_ of the **Privacy Request Manager**):
    - Inform-as-you-capture: Inform the data subjects about purposes and types of processing being done on their data, legal bases for processing and ways to exercise their "right"s
    - Collect consents during data capture
    - Single point of access to privacy-related information and controls
    - Transparent Privacy Request Response process and proof of compliance
- **(Out-of-the-box) Automated Privacy Management** (delivered by **Privacy Computation Engine**):
  - Single point of configuration for privacy metadata and workflows
  - Rich Privacy Metadata supporting automated response to most common Privacy Requests
  - Management of retention policies and automatic data expiry
  - Out-of-the box Privacy Requests resolution rule-sets for major regulations (GDPR etc.)
  - Automatically reconcile multiple legal bases for processing (Consents, Contracts, Legitimate Interests, etc.)
  - Configurable level of automation of Privacy Request Responses
  - Centralized interface from DPOs for Privacy Requests oversight and Management
  - Privacy Request history and proof of compliance
- **Interoperability** (delivered by **Interoperability Formats and Protocols**):
  - Shared understanding of privacy metadata and Privacy Request across systems sharing data
  - Coordinated response to Privacy Requests across systems sharing data
  - Consent and other Legal Base resolution in the context of multiple systems sharing data

## Product Components

[blindnet devkit](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/lexicon/RFC-Lexicon-2.md#blindnet-devkit) consists of a set of components, collectively called **Privacy Stack**. Those include:

- **Web components**: All the interfaces you may need to: allow Data Subjects to make Privacy Request in order to exercise control over their data; and to allow DPOs to respond to Privacy Requests and generate proof of compliance. Corresponds to [Privacy Request Builder a.k.a. Privacy Request Capture Interface](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/tree/main/refs/high-level-architecture#privacy-request-capture-interface) and [Data Consumer Interface](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/tree/main/refs/high-level-architecture#data-consumer-interface)

<img align="right" height="200" caption="Privacy Request Builder" src="./img/prb.png" />

- **Privacy Computation Engine**: Allows to automate the evaluation of compliance, retention date expiry, and the response to Privacy Requests. Corresponds to [Privacy Computation Engine component of HLA](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/tree/main/refs/high-level-architecture#privacy-computation-engine)
- **PRIV: Metadata Interoperability Format**: Allows Systems and their components to precisely communicate meta-data related to privacy using universally-understood semantics, which in turn enables automation of Privacy Request processing. Corresponds to [Schemas Component of HLA](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/tree/main/refs/high-level-architecture#schemas)
- **Encryption Engine**: A tool to ensure data confidentiality in a distributed setting. Corresponds to [Encryption and Access Management Engine of HLA](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/tree/main/refs/high-level-architecture#encryption-and-access-management-engine)
- **Data Access and Storage**: A data-base wrapper allowing to store data in a way optimized for maximal automation of privacy-workflows.

On top of **Privacy Stack**, blindnet may (alone, or in collaboration with partners) offer **Privacy Services** such as:

- Privacy Request processing (external DPO)
- Implementation services (Custom software and Privacy Stack integrations)
- Compliance Consulting services around compliance and best practices
- Management Consulting services, helping Organizations approach Privacy as an opportunity rather than as a threat
