PRIV (short for "Privacy Request Interchange Vocabulary") is defined as a "working draft" standard on GitHub via [a main RFC document](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md) and several complementary documents in [blindnet-io/product-management > /refs/schemas/](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/tree/main/refs/schemas).

It is a proposal for a simple vocabulary representing [Privacy Requests](./high-level-conceptualization#data-capture--privacy-requests) for interoperability.
