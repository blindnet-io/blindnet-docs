Welcome to blindnet devkit's documentation :wave:

:::warning Quick start

To learn all concepts step-by-step by doing, we strongly encourage you to start with our [Quick Start tutorial](./tutorial).

:::

The blindnet devkit is here to help you build trustworthy applications, with privacy embedded in its design and architecture.

<!-- FIXME: missing quick explainer (capture data with consent and encryption / build trust / automate) -->

It is composed of several independent components you can use separately, yet work wonders together!

Our [Quick Start tutorial](./tutorial) is here to give you a simple entry point to familiarize yourself with these components and understand how they play together.

The following sections of the documentation cover every detail, grouped by area:

- [Computation](./computation) with the Privacy Computation Engine, core of your privacy handling
- [User Interfaces](./interfaces) to embed in any web page or application
- [Access Management](./access-management) tools to manage your applications and users
- [Storage](./storage) solutions to connect new or existing storage systems to the devkit, for automation, and more
- [Data Capture](./data-capture) solutions to ease the process of capturing, storing and managing sensitive data and associated consents in a meaningful way
- [Encryption](./encryption) to protect your users privacy from end to end
