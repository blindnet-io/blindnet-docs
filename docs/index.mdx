Welcome to blindnet devkit's documentation :wave:

:::warning Quick start

To learn all concepts step-by-step by doing, we strongly encourage you to start with our [Quick Start tutorial](./tutorial).

:::

The blindnet devkit is here to help you build trustworthy applications, with privacy embedded in its design and architecture.

With this purpose in mind, it is mostly defined (and yet not limited to) two very important central concepts:

1. Data Capture: a specific set of sensitive data captured in a meaningful way[^1]
2. Privacy Request: a request from a person who shared sensitive data with you, to assert their right to privacy[^2]

Several independent components are here to cover these two workflows and more.

`} />

You can use these components separately. Yet, they work wonders together, supporting:

- **capture** of sensitive data with their associated user consent
- **users' privacy rights management**
- secured data **storage** and **automated management**
- end-to-end **encryption**
- **access management**
- secured **transfer** of sensitive data and associated user consent to compatible systems
- **privacy-aware** interfaces development

Our [Quick Start tutorial](./tutorial) is here to give you a simple entry point to familiarize yourself with these components and understand how they play together.

The following sections of the documentation cover every detail, grouped by area:

- [Computation](./computation), with the core Privacy Computation Engine, interpreting rights to hold and treat sensitive data and calculating responses to Privacy Requests
- [User Interfaces](./interfaces) to embed in any web page or application, easing daily operations and building trust with your users
- [Access Management](./access-management) tools to manage your applications and users
- [Storage](./storage) solutions to connect new or existing storage systems to the devkit, for automation, and more
- [Data Capture](./data-capture) solutions to ease the process of capturing, storing and managing sensitive data and associated consents in a meaningful way
- [Encryption](./encryption) to protect your users privacy from end to end
