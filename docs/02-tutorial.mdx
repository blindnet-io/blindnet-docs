import WipWarning from './_partials/_wip.mdx';

This tutorial doesnâ€™t assume any existing knowledge of the blindnet devkit or even any privacy related technologies.

We will simply walk you through the different components of the devkit to give you a better understanding of the overall structure and logic.

<WipWarning />

## 1. Configure the Privacy Computation Engine

The [Privacy Computation Engine](./computation) is the core of blindnet devkit.
It is a simple service you can interact with via a Rest API to create and track your users' [Privacy Requests](/docs/references/lexicon#privacy-request).

You don't need to configure or install a Privacy Computation Engine for this tutorial.
We simply pre-configured a dedicated custom instance for you on `https://devkit-pce-staging.azurewebsites.net/v0/` to makes things eathier.

You can call the Rest API yourself for specific usages.
However, you won't need to in this tutorial (and even in most real-life use cases), as other components of the devkit will transparently handle it themselves.

:::info

For more information, checkout the associated [Swagger](https://devkit-pce-staging.azurewebsites.net/swagger/#/Configuration), and the [Computation](./computation/) section of this documentation.

:::

:::note

In a real-life use case, you'll first need to register and obtain an application id, then confige to followings:

- General information of the organization
- Legal bases for storing and processing users' data
- Selectors for the data stored by the application
- Retention policies for data categories stored by the application
- Provenances
- Regulations applied to the data stored by the application

## 2. Set-up Storage

> :construction_worker: redaction in progress

A [Data Access Component](./storage/data-access) is here to transform requests from the [Privacy Computation Engine](/docs/computation) to efficiently execute automated operations on your data storage.

You can choose to use the [Capture Component](./data-capture) and directly store the captured data in blindnet's preconfigured storage, or your own storage service.

You can also directly connect the Data Access Component to your own storage service without using the Capture Component. For see sake of simplicity, we'll choose this option for this tutorial.

For that, we'll set up a dedicated demo storage service in Java, and connect it to the Capture Component using the [Java Storage Connector library](https://github.com/blindnet-io/storage-connector-java).

<!-- FIXME: set up a dedicated project and detail development and release steps -->
Code for this demo stage service can be found in the `example` directory in the librarie's repository: [github.com/blindnet-io/storage-connector-java > `example`](https://github.com/blindnet-io/storage-connector-java/tree/develop/example).

## 3. Initiate a Web App

> :construction_worker: redaction in progress

Web User Interfaces in the devkit are provided as Web Components, and can therefore be used in any Web page or project, with any framework or library.

Here, you can therefore create any new project or use an existing one to complete the next steps, following the related documentation from the framework or library you use:

- [React - Web Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/web-components.html)
- [Vue and Web Components](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/web-components.html#building-custom-elements-with-vue)

:::info
Angular only requires you to set-up the [`CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA`](https://angular.io/api/core/CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA) schema in order to use any Web Components without warnings or errors.

```typescript
import { NgModule, CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA } from '@angular/core';
import { YourComponent } from './your.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [YourComponent],
  schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA]
})
export class YourModule {}
```
:::

For this tutorial, we recommend using the [Open WC generator](https://open-wc.org/guides/developing-components/getting-started/) to initiate a simple Web App with [lit](https://lit.dev/), and even to simply use a basic HTML page for even more simplicity.

### Minimalist Demo Project

You can also refer to the simple demo project we created in the `demos/devkit-simple-tutorial` directory of the `privacy-components-web` monorepository.

For simplicity, this project is minimalist. It only use [lit](https://lit.dev/), with [Carbon Web Components](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/) and the [Vaadin Router](https://hilla.dev/docs/routing/router). Build system has been set up using the [Open WC generator](https://open-wc.org/guides/developing-components/getting-started/) (refer to the README for more information).

You can either directly clone the whole monorepo locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:blindnet-io/privacy-components-web.git
cd privacy-components-web/demos/devkit-simple-tutorial/
```

or use [git sparse-checkout](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-sparse-checkout) to only download the project itself:

```bash
mkdir devkit-web-demo
cd devkit-web-demo
git init
git remote add -f origin git@github.com:blindnet-io/privacy-components-web.git
git config core.sparsecheckout true
echo "demos/devkit-simple-tutorial" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
git pull origin main
```

Then, you'll need to install the project's dependencies using classic yarn (v1) or npm:

```bash
yarn install
# OR
npm install
```

Then, start the development server:

```bash
yarn start
# OR
npm start
```

and open the application in your browser using the given URL.

:::info
The next steps have been already developed in this demo project. You can therefore refer to it whenever in doubt.

## 4. Capture Data

> :construction_worker: redaction in progress

<!-- TODO: add information on how to capture data without the Capture Componet, i.e. call the demo storage service API to save a data from a simple HTML form -->

## 5. Install the Privacy Request Capture Interface

> :construction_worker: redaction in progress

### npm / yarn project

When using an npm / yarn project with your own build system, you can install the Privacy Request Capture Interface via the `@blindnet/prci` npm package.

```bash
yarn add @blindnet/prci
# OR
npm install --save @blindnet/prci
```

Then, import this package in the javascript or typescript file where you want to use this web component in order to register it:

```javascript
import '@blindnet/prci'
```

### Static HTML Page

If you want to use this Web Component without any build system, just add the associated script in your document:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@blindnet/prci/dist/index.core.min.js?module" type="module" ></script>
```

<!-- TODO: add more details or link to the associated documentation -->

### Using the Custom Element

You can then use the associated custom element in your JSX / HTML template / static page:

```html
<bldn-priv-request></bldn-priv-request>
```

<!-- TODO: add link to API doc and more details -->


## 6. Make a Privacy Request

> :construction_worker: redaction in progress

Open your web app / page, and follow the instructions given in the Privacy Request Capture Interface Web Component.

## 7. Install the Data Consumer Interface

> :construction_worker: redaction in progress

Tp add the Data Consumer Interface Web Component to your project, simply follow the same steps as for the Privacy Request Capture Interface one, but with the `@blindnet/dci` npm package, and `<bldn-data-consum>` HTML custom element.

<!-- TODO: add link to API doc and more details -->

## 8. Accept a Privacy Request

> :construction_worker: redaction in progress

Open your web app / page, and follow the instructions given in the Privacy Data Consumer Interface Web Component.
