This tutorial doesn’t assume any existing knowledge of the blindnet devkit or even any privacy related technologies.

We will simply walk you through the different components of the devkit to give you a better understanding of the overall structure and logic.

<WipWarning />

## 1. Configure the Privacy Computation Engine

The [Privacy Computation Engine](./computation) is the core of blindnet devkit.
It is a simple service you can interact with via a Rest API to create and track your users' [Privacy Requests](/docs/references/lexicon#privacy-request).

You don't need to configure or install a Privacy Computation Engine for this tutorial.
We simply pre-configured a dedicated custom instance for you on `https://devkit-pce-staging.azurewebsites.net/v0/` to makes things eathier.

You can call the Rest APÏ yourself for specific usages.
However, you won't need to in this tutorial (and even in most real-life use cases), as other components of the devkit will transparently handle it themselves.
