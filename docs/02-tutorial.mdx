:::info

This tutorial doesnâ€™t assume any existing knowledge of the blindnet devkit or even any privacy related technologies.

:::

The purpose of the following tutorial is to serve as a entry point for the blindnet devkit, by simply walking you through its different components to give you a better understanding of the overall structure and logic.

Doing so, we'll answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of the Privacy Computation Engine?
- How to automatically update stored data when managing Pricacy Requests?
- How to add Pricacy Requests and Data Consumer interfaces to your Web applications?

:::tip Further Readings

We strongly recommend to read the linked sections of the documentation for more details.

:::

## 1. Configure the Privacy Computation Engine

The [Privacy Computation Engine](./computation) is the core of blindnet devkit.
It is a simple service you can interact with via a Rest API to create and track your users' [Privacy Requests](/docs/references/lexicon#privacy-request).

Using the Privacy Computation Engine goes in three steps:

1. **[App Management](./computation/apps-management)**: register and obtain an application id;
2. **[Configuration](./computation/configuration)**: configure the service using its configuration API;
3. **Development**: call the Privacy Computation Engine from your registered application to handle Privacy Requests

Step _(1) App Management_ and _(2) Configuration_ don't need to be addressed for this tutorial.

:::tip Pre-configured Instance

To make things eathier for this tutorial, we already pre-configured a dedicated custom instance for you to play with:

<div class="text--center">

**`https://devkit-pce-staging.azurewebsites.net/v0/`**

</div>

:::

Step _(3) Development_ can be achieved directly by calling the standalone Privacy Computation Engine [REST API](https://devkit-pce-staging.azurewebsites.net/swagger/).

However, the true strength of the blindnet devkit comes when combining its various components, thus drastically improving your developer experience and productivity while giving you access to additional features.

<!-- ## 2. Capture Data -->
<!-- TODO: add information on how to capture data without the Capture Componet, i.e. call the demo storage service API to save a data from a simple HTML form -->

## 2. Install the Privacy Request Capture Interface

User interfaces for the blindnet devkit are delivered as Web Components.

See [Using Web Components](/docs/interfaces/using-web-components) for more information on how to integrate Web Components in your project.

:::tip Minimalist Demo Project

You can also refer to the simple demo project we created in the `demos/devkit-simple-tutorial` directory of the `privacy-components-web` monorepository.

For simplicity, this project is minimalist. It only use [lit](https://lit.dev/), with [Carbon Web Components](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/) and the [Vaadin Router](https://hilla.dev/docs/routing/router). Build system has been set up using the [Open WC generator](https://open-wc.org/guides/developing-components/getting-started/) (refer to the README for more information).

You can either directly clone the whole monorepo locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:blindnet-io/privacy-components-web.git
cd privacy-components-web/demos/devkit-simple-tutorial/
```

or use [git sparse-checkout](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-sparse-checkout) to only download the project itself:

```bash
mkdir devkit-web-demo
cd devkit-web-demo
git init
git remote add -f origin git@github.com:blindnet-io/privacy-components-web.git
git config core.sparsecheckout true
echo "demos/devkit-simple-tutorial" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
git pull origin main
```

Then, you'll need to install the project's dependencies using classic yarn (v1) or npm:

```bash
yarn install
# OR
npm install
```

Then, start the development server:

```bash
yarn start
# OR
npm start
```

and open the application in your browser using the given URL.

The next steps have been already developed in this demo project. You can therefore refer to it whenever in doubt.

:::

### npm / yarn project

When using an npm / yarn project with your own build system, you can install the Privacy Request Capture Interface via the `@blindnet/prci` npm package.

```bash
yarn add @blindnet/prci
# OR
npm install --save @blindnet/prci
```

Then, import this package in the javascript or typescript file where you want to use this web component in order to register it:

```javascript
import '@blindnet/prci'
```

### Static HTML Page

If you want to use this Web Component without any build system, just add the associated script in your document:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@blindnet/prci/dist/index.core.min.js?module" type="module" ></script>
```

<!-- TODO: add more details or link to the associated documentation -->

### Using the Custom Element

You can then use the associated custom element in your JSX / HTML template / static page:

```html
<bldn-priv-request></bldn-priv-request>
```

<!-- TODO: add link to API doc and more details -->


## 3. Make a Privacy Request

Open your web app / page, and follow the instructions given in the Privacy Request Capture Interface Web Component.

<!-- TODO: add link to User doc -->

## 4. Install the Data Consumer Interface

Tp add the Data Consumer Interface Web Component to your project, simply follow the same steps as for the Privacy Request Capture Interface one, but with the `@blindnet/dci` npm package, and `<bldn-data-consum>` HTML custom element.

<!-- TODO: add link to API doc and more details -->

## 5. Accept a Privacy Request

> :construction_worker: redaction in progress

Open your web app / page, and follow the instructions given in the Privacy Data Consumer Interface Web Component.

## 6. Set-up Storage

A [Data Access Component](./storage/data-access) is here to transform requests from the [Privacy Computation Engine](/docs/computation) to efficiently execute automated operations on your data storage.

You can choose to use the [Capture Component](./data-capture) and directly store the captured data in blindnet's preconfigured storage, or your own storage service.

You can also directly connect the Data Access Component to your own storage service without using the Capture Component. For see sake of simplicity, we'll choose this option for this tutorial.

For that, we'll set up a dedicated demo storage service in Java, and connect it to the Capture Component using the [Java Storage Connector library](https://github.com/blindnet-io/storage-connector-java).

<!-- FIXME: set up a dedicated project and detail development and release steps -->
Code for this demo stage service can be found in the `example` directory in the librarie's repository: [github.com/blindnet-io/storage-connector-java > `example`](https://github.com/blindnet-io/storage-connector-java/tree/develop/example).
