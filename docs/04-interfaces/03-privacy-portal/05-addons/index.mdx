The Privacy Portal supports adding additional steps (addons) to the privacy request building process, through the `<bldn-request-addon>` element included in the [`@blindnet/privacy-portal`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blindnet/privacy-portal) package.

Addons define a UI step and submit function, occuring in the **pre-form** (before the action form) phase or **post-form** (after the action form) phase.

We have a [**tutorial**](/docs/tutorials/request-addons) for creating a simple addon and [**examples**](https://github.com/blindnet-io/devkit-quickstart/tree/main/examples/privacy-portal/addons) of more ways you can use them.
