Web User Interfaces in the devkit are provided as Web Components, and can therefore be used in any Web page or project, with any framework or library.

## HTML (Generic Case)

Using a Web Component is as simple as importing it, and using the new tags in an HTML document.

For example, to use the blindnet Privacy Request Capture Interface Web Component:

```html
<script type="module"   src="https://unpkg.com/@blindnet/prci/dist/index.core.min.js?module"></script>
...
<bldn-priv-request></bldn-priv-request>
```

For more information on Web Components, see [WebComponents.org](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction) and [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components).

## React

See [React - Web Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/web-components.html).

## Vue

See [Vue and Web Components](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/web-components.html#building-custom-elements-with-vue)

## Angular

Angular only requires you to set-up the [`CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA`](https://angular.io/api/core/CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA) schema in order to use any Web Components without warnings or errors.

```typescript
import { NgModule, CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA } from '@angular/core';
import { YourComponent } from './your.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [YourComponent],
  schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA]
})
export class YourModule {}
```

## Lit

[Lit](https://lit.dev/) is built with standard Web Components in mind. It therefore doesn't require to follow any specific steps in order to use external Web Components.

As a matter of fact, it is the library we use to build all Web Components in the devkit. As a consequence, using blindnet Web Components in a Lit context has the additional benefit of removing any need to load this additional library (saving you around [5.9kB](https://bundlephobia.com/package/lit) at runtime).

We recommend using the [Open WC generator](https://open-wc.org/guides/developing-components/getting-started/) along with [Modern Web](https://modern-web.dev/) tools to build Modern Web Apps with the Privacy Components for the Web.
