User interfaces for the blindnet devkit (aka _[Privacy Components for the Web](https://github.com/blindnet-io/privacy-components-web)_) are delivered as standard Web Components available on both npm and a CDN.

As a consequence, installing the blindnet devkit web interfaces doesn't involve any specificity, as you can install and use them as you would with any other standard Web Component.

See [Using Web Components](/docs/interfaces/install/using-web-components) for more information on how to integrate Web Components in your existing project.

## Components

| name           | npm package                | html element            |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Privacy Portal | `@blindnet/privacy-portal` | `<bldn-privacy-portal>` |
| Bridge         | `@blindnet/bridge`         | `<bldn-bridge>`         |

## npm / yarn project

When using an npm / yarn project with your own build system, you can install any Privacy Component for the Web via a dedicated npm package under the `@blindnet` scope.

For example, run the following command to install the Privacy Portal component:

```bash
yarn add @blindnet/prci
# OR
npm install --save @blindnet/prci
```

Then, import this package in the javascript or typescript file where you want to use this web component in order to register its associated custom element:

```javascript
import '@blindnet/prci';
```

## Static HTML Page

If you want to use this Web Component without any build system, just add the associated script in your document:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@blindnet/prci/dist/index.core.min.js?module" type="module"></script>
```

<!-- TODO: add more details or link to the associated documentation -->

## Using the Custom Element

You can then use the associated custom element in your JSX / HTML template / static page:

```html
<bldn-privacy-portal></bldn-privacy-portal>
```
