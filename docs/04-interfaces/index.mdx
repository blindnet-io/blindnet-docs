The PC4W project uses [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for UI development, testing, and documentation.

Go to our automatically deployed [Storybook instance](https://pc4w.blindnet.dev) for more details about each component, and to test them yourself live.

:::

The blindnet devkit includes several user interfaces allowing users of all types to interact through Privacy Requests and developers to execute privacy-by-design and privacy UX.

Those interfaces are delivered as a collection of Web Components and JS libraries called [Privacy Components for the Web (PC4W)](https://github.com/blindnet-io/privacy-components-web).

This allows you to embed any of these user interfaces independently in any web page or application.

In its current state, the Privacy Components for the Web project provides:

- a [Privacy Portal](/docs/interfaces/privacy-portal), allowing your users to assert their privacy rights by sending you [Privacy Requests](/docs/references/lexicon#privacy-request)
- a [Bridge](https://pc4w.blindnet.dev/?path=/docs/dci), allowing relevant members of your organization (e.g. system administrators or DPOs) to manage all Privacy Request related matters
