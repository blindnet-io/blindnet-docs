The blindnet devkit includes several user interfaces allowing users of all types to interact through Privacy Requests and developers to execute privacy-by-design and privacy UX. 

Those interfaces are delivered as a collection of Web Components and JS libraries called [Privacy Components for the Web](https://github.com/blindnet-io/privacy-components-web).

This allows you to embed any of these user interfaces independently in any web page or application.

In its current state, the Privacy Components for the Web project provides:

- a Privacy Request Capture Interface (PRCI), allowing your users to assert their privacy rights by sending you [Privacy Requests](/docs/references/lexicon#privacy-request)
- a Data Consumer Interface (DCI), allowing relevant members of your organization (e.g. system administrators or DPOs) to manage all Privacy Request related matters
