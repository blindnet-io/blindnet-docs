The blindnet devkit provides several user interfaces to allow different kinds of users to interact around Privacy Requests and help developers to execute privacy-by-design and privacy UX. 

Those interfaces are delivered as a collection of Web Components and JS libraries called [Privacy Components for the Web](https://github.com/blindnet-io/privacy-components-web).

This allows you to embed any of these user interfaces independently in any web page or application.
