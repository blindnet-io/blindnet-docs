# Configuring your Privacy Computation Engine

<WipWarning repo="https://github.com/blindnet-io/privacy-computation-engine">
  <p>The Customization API for the Privacy Computation Engine is in active development.</p>
  <p>At this stage, this document is therefore mostly conceptual. Concrete API instructions will be added soon.</p>
  <p>In the meantime, we encourage you to refer to the <a href="https://devkit-pce-staging.azurewebsites.net/swagger/">API Swagger Documentation</a></p>
</WipWarning>

You must first configure the Privacy Computation Engine in order to make the most of it.

It needs to know about:

- General information about your Organization and its' data processing policies (Equivalent to a RoPA - Record of Processing Activities)
- Mappings of your data structures to [PRIV](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md) Data Categories
- Few choices you have to make about when to authenticate the user (before or after they make a Privacy Request), and when to deliver automatic responses and when to wait for validation

To Configure your Privacy Computation Engine prepare the following information:
