# Configuring your Privacy Computation Engine

For the PCE to give you recommended actions adapted to your specific architecture and needs, you first need to configure it via its [**configuration API**](https://devkit-pce-staging.azurewebsites.net/swagger/#/Configuration).

This API allows you to define:

- [General information](#configuring-general-information) about your Organization and its' data processing policies (Equivalent to a [RoPA - Record of Processing Activities](https://www.cnil.fr/en/record-processing-activities))
- Mappings of your data structures to [PRIV](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md) Data Categories
- Few choices you have to make about when to authenticate the user (before or after they make a Privacy Request), and when to deliver automatic responses and when to wait for validation

## General Information

:::tip API

General information can be set in the PCE using [PUT /configure/general-info](https://devkit-pce-staging.azurewebsites.net/swagger/#/Configuration/putV0ConfigureGeneral-info), retrieved using [GET /configure/general-info](https://devkit-pce-staging.azurewebsites.net/swagger/#/Configuration/getV0ConfigureGeneral-info), as detailed in the related `GeneralInformation` schema.

Your audience needs access to the full picture of your organization's data processing policies easily and at all times. Not only because it is a legal requirement, but also and more importantly because people need such information to trust your organization enough so they can give you access to their sensitive data.

<Legislation>

[Article 30 of the GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-30-gdpr/) requires controllers and their representatives to maintain a precise information set called [Record of Processing Activities (ROPA)](https://www.cnil.fr/en/record-processing-activities).

Configuring the general information in the Privacy Computation Engine helps your organization to meet this requirement by using other components of the DevKit (e.g. [interfaces](/docs/interfaces)).

</Legislation>

While such information is mostly composed of a set of static text, it can rapidly get difficult to maintain. Moreover, transforming such data into intelligible and unambiguous content for your audience isn't straightforward.

Here, using the blindnet devkit can greatly help you to solve both problems:

1. the PCE infers as many pieces of information as possible to minimize the volume of data to configure and maintain
2. other components of the devkit are here to provide such data to the user in an intelligible form without extensive implementation effort

:::caution

This general information describes the entities legislatively responsible for sensitive data and privacy-rights protection. Therefore, it shouldn't necessarily represent only your organization if you are processing sensitive data on behalf of others.

For example, the `organization` field holds information about the organization processing the data and its representative, be it your organization **or** your organization and the organization(s) on behalf of which you are processing data.

The same logic applies to the `dpo` field, which holds information about your DPO **or** the DPO(s) of the organization(s) on behalf of which you are processing data.

## Selectors

:::tip API

Selectors can be set in the PCE using [PUT /configure/selectors](https://devkit-pce-staging.azurewebsites.net/swagger/#/Configuration/putV0ConfigureSelectors), retrieved using [GET /configure/selectors](https://devkit-pce-staging.azurewebsites.net/swagger/#/Configuration/getV0ConfigureSelectors), and is detailed in the related `CreateSelectorPayload` schema.

:::

Sensitive data you capture on a regular base can often be complex to categorize.

The blindnet devkit gives you a clear [set of data categories](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/dictionary/data-categories/en.data-categories.json) you can use to qualify collected sensitive data for efficient privacy management.

A selector can be defined as a subcategory of any of these data categories, using [dot notation](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#term-dot-notation), to qualify [any captured data](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#data-capture-fragments).

For example, you can define a `FINANCIAL.BANK-ACCOUNT.IBAN`, as a subcategory of the predefined `FINANCIAL.BANK-ACCOUNT` category, to identify and retrieve an IBAN number collected for regular payment.

<!-- TODO: link to the data capture section instead once it's done -->
Refer to the definition of [Data Capture Fragments in PRIV](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#data-capture-fragments) for more details.

:::warning

Each selector is defined by it's full dot notation (`{data_category}.{subcategory}`).

Using just `{subcategory}` will lead to an error.

`{subcategory}` can however be optional, as any data category can be used as a selector.

## Legal Bases

:::tip API

Legal Bases configuration can be set is the PCE using [PUT /configure/legal-bases](https://devkit-pce-staging.azurewebsites.net/swagger/#/Configuration/putV0ConfigureLegal-bases), retrieved using [GET /configure/legal-bases](https://devkit-pce-staging.azurewebsites.net/swagger/#/Configuration/getV0ConfigureLegal-bases), and is detailed in the related `CreateLegalBasePayload` schema.

:::

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Format | Example |
| :----: | :------ |
| [Legal Bases](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#legal-base) | `legal-base`: `CONTRACT` with no `scope` specified meaning it refers to all data, processing and purposes |

<!-- Configure consents, contracts, legitimate interests and necessary legal bases for handling users' data. -->

To define the scope of a legal base, you can see the list of eligible [data categories](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/dictionary/data-categories/en.data-categories.json) (can include selectors), [processing categories](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/dictionary/processing-categories/en.processing-categories.json) and [purposes of processing](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/dictionary/purposes/en.purposes.json).

Refer to [legal bases](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#lifecycle-of-legal-bases-for-data-processing) in PRIV for more details.

## Retention Policies

:::tip API

Legal Bases configuration can be set is the PCE using [PUT /configure/retention-policies](https://devkit-pce-staging.azurewebsites.net/swagger/#/Configuration/putV0ConfigureRetention-policies), and is detailed in the related `CreateRetentionPolicy` schema.

:::

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Format | Example |
| :----: | :------ |
| [Retention Policies](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#retention-policy) | `data-categories`:`CONTACT`; `policy-type`:`NO-LONGER-THAN`, `duration`: `180 days`, `after`: `RELATIONSHIP-END` |

<!-- configure retention policies for data categories. -->

Refer to [retention policies](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#retention-policy) in PRIV for more details.

## Provenances

:::tip API

Legal Bases configuration can be set is the PCE using [PUT /configure/provenances](https://devkit-pce-staging.azurewebsites.net/swagger/#/Configuration/putV0ConfigureProvenances), and is detailed in the related `CreateProvenancePayload` schema.

:::

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Format | Example |
| :----: | :------ |
| [Provenance](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#provenance) | `provenance-category`:`USER.DATA-SUBJECT`, `system`: `id of this system to which the user gives their e-mail address` |

Use [PUT /configure/provenances](https://devkit-pce-staging.azurewebsites.net/swagger/#/Configuration/putV0ConfigureProvenances) to configure provenances for data categories.

Provenance object represents the origin of the data.
