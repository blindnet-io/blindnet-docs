# Configuring your Privacy Computation Engine

For the PCE to work in your specific situation, you first need to configure it via its [**configuration API**](https://stage.computing.blindnet.io/swagger/#/Configuration).

<Legislation>
This API allows you to define what is usually called <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/record-processing-activities" target="_blank">RoPA - Record of Processing Activities</a>, a way to comply with the requirements of Article 30 of GDPR but also with various CCPA requirements.
</Legislation>

In blindnet DevKit defining a RoPA means configuring the following:
- [General information](#general-information) about your Organization, its representatives, its server's locations and policies
- [Selectors](#selectors) tell the PCE which fields in your database schema correspond to which [PRIV](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md) Data Categories
- [Legal Bases](#legal-bases) for processing of particular Data Categories for Particular Purposes
- [Retention Policies](#retention-policies) specifying minimal and maximal retention times for particular Data Categories
- [Provenances](#provenances) defining where your system gets the data from

In addition, you can configure how you want the PCE to behave:
- [Demand Resolution Strategy](#demand-resolution-strategy) : when (for what kind of Privacy Requests) to deliver automatic responses and when to wait for human validation
- [Regulations](#regulations): add additional rule sets specific to certain regulations


:::tip API

In order to follow through this section of the tutorial, you might want to either [set-up your own instance of PCE](/docs/tutorials/intro/PCE-set-up) or use the PCE isntance provided by blindnet for testing at https://devkit-pce-staging.azurewebsites.net/v0/. In the followign examples we'll use this instance.

If you are using the instance provided by blindnet you will need to reach out to us to get your `app_id` and `app_key`. Once you have got those, you can use our [Token Generator](https://blindnet-io.github.io/demo-token-generator/) to generate the credentials that you will need in order to authenticate your calls to our APIs.

In the following examples replace the blindnet's testing instance URL with your URL, where you are hosting your PCE instance, and replace the the auth-token with your token generated using the Token Generator.

## General Information

General information can be set in the PCE using [PUT /configure/general-info](https://stage.computing.blindnet.io/swagger/#/Configuration/putV0ConfigureGeneral-info), retrieved using [GET /configure/general-info](https://stage.computing.blindnet.io/swagger/#/Configuration/getV0ConfigureGeneral-info), as detailed in the related `GeneralInformation` schema.

You will need the following information.

| [General Info schema](https://stage.computing.blindnet.io/swagger/#/Configuration/getV0ConfigureGeneral-info) field | Information | Related Legislation Articles | Usage by blindnet DevKit |
| :--------------------: | :----------- | :------:| :---------------:|
| `organization` | The name of your organization and its representative representative... | GDPR Art. 30.1.a, GDPR Art. 30.2.a | To reply to any `TRANSPARENCY.ORGANIZATION` Privacy Request |
| `dpo` | The name and contact of your data protection officer | GDPR Art. 30.1.a, GDPR Art. 30.2.a | Reply to any `TRANSPARENCY.DPO` Privacy Requests |
| `data_consumer_categories` | The categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed including recipients in third countries or international organisations | GDPR Art. 30.1.a, GDPR Art. 30.2.a, CCPA 1798.115.1.2, CCPA 1798.110.1.4 | Reply to any `TRANSPARENCY.WHO` Privacy Request |
| `data_security_info` | a general description of the technical and organisational security measures | GDPR Art. 30.1.d, GDPR Art. 30.2.d | |
| `countries` | Countries where user data is being stored | GDPR Art. 30.1.e, GDPR Art. 30.2.c | Reply to any `TRANSPARENCY.WHERE` Privacy Requests |
| `privacy_policy_link` | URL to your Privacy Policy | GDPR Art. 13, GDPR Art. 14, GDPR Art. 15 | Reply to any `TRANSPARENCY.POLICY` Privacy Requests. Make sure your Privacy Policy includes the [information listed in relevant GDPR articles](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#storing-general-information) |

:::caution

This general information describes the entities legislatively responsible for sensitive data and privacy-rights protection. Therefore, it shouldn't necessarily represent only your organization if you are processing sensitive data on behalf of others.

For example, the `organization` field holds information about the organization processing the data and its representative, be it your organization **or** your organization and the organization(s) on behalf of which you are processing data.

The same logic applies to the `dpo` field, which holds information about your DPO **or** the DPO(s) of the organization(s) on behalf of which you are processing data.

:::

## Selectors

:::tip API

Selectors can be set in the PCE using [PUT /configure/selectors](https://stage.computing.blindnet.io/swagger/#/Configuration/putV0ConfigureSelectors) as detailed in the related `CreateSelectorPayload` schema.

:::

<Legislation>
Setting the selectors is important in order to reply to any `TRANSPARENCY.DATA-CATEGORIES` Privacy Request, and comply with several regulations (GDPR Art. 30.1.c, GDPR Art. 15.1.b, CCPA 1798.100.1, CCPA 1798.110.1.1, CCPA 1798.115.1.1, 1798.115.1.2, CCPA 1798.115.1.3). They are also used to idnetify particular user data relevant for a particular request and execute operations over the data storage.
</Legislation>

Sensitive data you capture can often be complex to categorize.

The blindnet devkit gives you a clear [set of data categories](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/dictionary/data-categories/en.data-categories.json) you can use to qualify collected sensitive data for efficient privacy management.

A selector, corresponding to a particular field in your databse, can be defined as a subcategory of any of these data categories. This is done using [dot notation](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#term-dot-notation).

For example, you can define a `FINANCIAL.BANK-ACCOUNT.IBAN`, as a subcategory of the predefined `FINANCIAL.BANK-ACCOUNT` category, to identify and retrieve an IBAN number collected for regular payment.

<!-- TODO: link to the data capture section instead once it's done -->

_Refer to the definition of [Data Capture Fragments in PRIV](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#data-capture-fragments) for more details._

If you are using an automatic data cataloging tool, you may want to consider our [mappings to vocabularies used by major software vendors](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/compatibility.md).

:::caution

Each selector is defined by its full dot notation (`{data_category}.{subcategory}`).

Using just `{subcategory}` will lead to an error.

`{subcategory}` is however optional, as any data category can be used as a selector.

:::

## Legal Bases

:::tip API

Legal Bases can be set in the PCE using [PUT /configure/legal-bases](https://stage.computing.blindnet.io/swagger/#/Configuration/putV0ConfigureLegal-bases), retrieved using [GET /configure/legal-bases](https://stage.computing.blindnet.io/swagger/#/Configuration/getV0ConfigureLegal-bases), as detailed in the related `CreateLegalBasePayload` schema.

:::

To configure Legal Bases means to inform the PCE about which kinds of data (Data Categories) are being processed in which way (Processing Categories) for which Purpose and under which Legal Base for that processing.

This describes, in a nutshell, every operation over user data that your system performs. PCE uses this information to both inform the data subjects (in the context of requests of type `TRANSPARENCY.LEGAL-BASES`, `TRANSPARENCY.DATA-CATEGORIES`, `TRANSPARENCY.PROCESSING-CATEGORIES`, `TRANSPARENCY.PURPOSE`), and determine possible reponses to `OBJECT`, `RESTRICT`, and `DELETE` Privacy Requests.

E.g. If you operate a promotional mailing list to which users subscribed and gave consent, you are likely to be processing (Processing Categories: `COLLECTING`, `STORING`, and `USING`) users' data (Data Categories: `CONTACT.EMAIL`, `NAME`) for marketing purposes (Purpose: `MARKETING`) with users consent (Legal Base Type : `CONSENT`). If a user signed a contract with you / subscribed to a service you provide, then it might be legitimate to process their data, regardless of consent, for the purposes of delivering the service to them (Legal Base Type : `CONTRACT`). In some cases you might be in a situation to simply have to collect user's data for compliance with financial regulations (Legal Base Type : `NECESSARY.LEGAL-OBLIGATION`), etc. You may have more than one legal base for the same data.

<Legislation>
Provding information about Legal Bases and Purposes of processing is made mandatory by GDPR (Art. 12, Art. 13, Art. 15, Art. 30.1.b, and Art 30.2.b), CCPA (1798.100.1, 1798.110.1.1, 1798.110.1.3, 1798.115.1.1, 1798.115.1.2, 1798.115.1.3) and other relevant regulations.
</Legislation>

Our metadata language, [PRIV](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md), is designed for exhaustive coverage of a variety of situations while at the same time making configuration easy in most common situations. It contains pre-defined terms inspired from texts of major privacy regulations. While you can extend the PRIV vocabulary to fit your needs, we recommend using pre-defined categories whenever possible in order to maximize interoperability and leverage built-in PCE rules.

_Refer to the legal bases [lifecycle](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#lifecycle-of-legal-bases-for-data-processing) and [format](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#legal-base) definition in PRIV for more details._


### Types of Legal bases

_Legal Bases' Types_ can be defined via a dedicated set of [terms](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/dictionary/legal-bases/en.legal-bases.json).

### Privacy Scope of a Legal base

By default, a legal base is defined without a specific scope. This means it refers to all data, processing and purposes.

However, most legal bases are only bound to specific contexts.
Such contexts can be defined by three aspects:

- _Categories of Processing_: what you intend to do with the data, e.g. `COLLECTING`
- _Data Categories_: what type of data is used during the operation, e.g. `CONTACT`
- _Purpose of Processing_: what type of data is concerned, e.g. `PERSONALIZATION`

:::tip

You can phrase a privacy scope in a sentence of the form:

<p align="center">
  « We <strong>need</strong>{' '}
  <em>
    <code>Processings</code>
  </em>{' '}
  <strong>of/on</strong>{' '}
  <em>
    <code>Data Categories</code>
  </em>{' '}
  <strong>for</strong>{' '}
  <em>
    <code>Purposes</code>
  </em>
  . »
</p>

:::

Here again, these three parameters can be set using specific sets of terms with dot notation:

- [data categories](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/dictionary/data-categories/en.data-categories.json) (can be extended to include selectors)
- [processing categories](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/dictionary/processing-categories/en.processing-categories.json)
- [purposes of processing](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/dictionary/purposes/en.purposes.json)

## Retention Policies

:::tip API

Retention policies can be set in the PCE using [PUT /configure/retention-policies](https://stage.computing.blindnet.io/swagger/#/Configuration/putV0ConfigureRetention-policies) as detailed in the related `CreateRetentionPolicy` schema.

:::

Retention policies define how long you can or must keep each data after a specific event occurs. The PCE uses this information to inform the data subjects when responding to `TRANSPARENCY.RETENTION` requests and to prevent `DELETE` requests from being accepted as long as the data must be kept.

<Legislation>
Provding information about your Retention Policies is made mandatory by GDPR (Art. 13.2.a, Art. 14.2.a, Art. 15.1.d, Art. 30.1.f) and other relevant regulations.
</Legislation>

:::tip

You can phrase a retention policy in a sentence of the form:

<p align="center">
  « <strong>Keep</strong>{' '}
  <em>
    <code>Data Category</code>
  </em>{' '}
  <strong>for</strong>{' '}
  <em>
    <code>no longer / less than</code>
  </em>{' '}
  <em>
    <code>duration</code>
  </em>{' '}
  <strong>after</strong>{' '}
  <em>
    <code>Event Type</code>
  </em>
  . »
</p>

:::

You can define a retention policy in the PCE by associating:

- a type of event (`after`), using the associated predefined [set of terms](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/dictionary/events)
- with a certain category of data (`data_category`), using a pre-configured [selector](#selectors)
- for a specific point in time, defined by:
  - a before/after operator (`policy`) called "retention term" (`NO-LONGER-THAN`, `NO-LESS-THAN`, or any of their subcategories defined according to dot notation as defined [in PRIV](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/dictionary/retentions/en.retentions.json))
  - and a `duration` (using the [ISO 8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations))

For example, the following defines contact data shouldn't be kept more than 30 days after the associated service ended:

```json
{
  "data_categoy": "CONTACT",
  "policy": "NO-LONGER-THAN",
  "duration": "P30D",
  "after": "SERVICE-END"
}
```

Based on your Retention Policies configuration, the PCE will:

- **recommend deletion** of data belonging to a category associated with a `NO-LONGER-THAN` retention policy when this policy expires;
- **deny deletions** following a _DELETE_ privacy request if the targetted data belongs to a category with a still active `NO-LESS-THAN` policy.

_Refer to [retention policies](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#retention-policy) in PRIV for more details._

## Provenances

:::tip API

Provenances configuration can be set in the PCE using [PUT /configure/provenances](https://stage.computing.blindnet.io/swagger/#/Configuration/putV0ConfigureProvenances), and is detailed in the related `CreateProvenancePayload` schema.

:::

Provenances represent the possible origins of each data.

<Legislation>
Provding provenance information is made mandatory by GDPR (Art. 14.2.f, Art. 15.1.g), CCPA (1798.110.1.2) and other relevant regulations.
</Legislation>

For the blindnet devkit, we define a provenance by combining:

- a specific category of data (`data_category`), using a pre-configured [selector](#selectors)
- a provenance term, with an associated predefined [set of terms](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/dictionary/provenance/en.provenance.json)
- a URL, used as a unique ID to identify the privacy system which has either:
    1. collected the data (if it has been collected from a user or derived)
    2. OR initiated its transfer

:::tip

You can phrase a provenance in a sentence of the form:

<p align="center">
  « <em>
    <code>Data Category</code>
  </em>{' '}
  <strong>is provided by / has been</strong>{' '}
  <em>
    <code>provenance</code> (<code>USER</code>, <code>TRANSFERED</code>, ...)
  </em>{' '}
  <strong>via</strong>{' '}
  <em>
    <code>system</code>
  </em>
  . »
</p>

:::

For example, the following indicates contact phone numbers are provided by users of the `https://blindnet.io` system:

```json
{
  "data_category": "CONTACT.PHONE",
  "provenance": "USER",
  "system": "https://blindnet.io"
}
```

_Refer to [Provenance](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#provenance) in PRIV for more details._

## Demand Resolution Strategy

:::tip API

Demand Resolution Strategy can be set in the PCE using [PUT /configure/demand-resolution-strategy](https://stage.computing.blindnet.io/swagger/#/Configuration/putV0ConfigureDemand-resolution-strategy) as detailed in the related `DemandResolutionStrategy` schema.

:::

Demand Resolution Strategy allows you to set to "auto" the processing of certain of types of Privacy Request Demands.

## Regulations

:::tip API

Regulations can be set in the PCE using [PUT /configure/regulations](https://stage.computing.blindnet.io/swagger/#/Configuration/putV0ConfigureRegulations) as detailed in the related `Regulations` schema.

:::

Regulations allow to load additional, regulation-sepcific rules that you want your PCE to apply.

For instance, under GDPR, processing certain categories of data (e.g. biometric...) is prohibited even with data subjects' consent.
PCE can enforce those rules.

For convenience, we provide a pre-defined set of [GDPR rules](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/prohibited-scope-gdpr.md) that we advise you to load if you want to comply with this regulation.
