# Configuring your Privacy Computation Engine

For the PCE to give you recommended actions adapted to your specific architecture and needs, you first need to configure it via its [**configuration API**](https://devkit-pce-staging.azurewebsites.net/swagger/#/Configuration).

This API allows you to define:

- [General information](#configuring-general-information) about your Organization and its' data processing policies (Equivalent to a [RoPA - Record of Processing Activities](https://www.cnil.fr/en/record-processing-activities))
- Mappings of your data structures to [PRIV](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md) Data Categories
- Few choices you have to make about when to authenticate the user (before or after they make a Privacy Request), and when to deliver automatic responses and when to wait for validation

## General Information

:::tip API

General information can be set in the PCE using [PUT /configure/general-info](https://devkit-pce-staging.azurewebsites.net/swagger/#/Configuration/putV0ConfigureGeneral-info), retrieved using [GET /configure/general-info](https://devkit-pce-staging.azurewebsites.net/swagger/#/Configuration/getV0ConfigureGeneral-info), as detailed in the related `GeneralInformation` schema.

:::

Your audience needs access to the full picture of your organization's data processing policies easily and at all times. Not only because it is a legal requirement, but also and more importantly because people need such information to trust your organization enough so they can give you access to their sensitive data.

<Legislation>

[Article 30 of the GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-30-gdpr/) requires controllers and their representatives to maintain a precise information set called [Record of Processing Activities (ROPA)](https://www.cnil.fr/en/record-processing-activities).

Configuring the general information in the Privacy Computation Engine helps your organization to meet this requirement by using other components of the DevKit (e.g. [interfaces](/docs/interfaces)).

</Legislation>

While such information is mostly composed of a set of static text, it can rapidly get difficult to maintain. Moreover, transforming such data into intelligible and unambiguous content for your audience isn't straightforward.

Here, using the blindnet devkit can greatly help you to solve both problems:

1. the PCE infers as many pieces of information as possible to minimize the volume of data to configure and maintain
2. other components of the devkit are here to provide such data to the user in an intelligible form without extensive implementation effort

:::caution

This general information describes the entities legislatively responsible for sensitive data and privacy-rights protection. Therefore, it shouldn't necessarily represent only your organization if you are processing sensitive data on behalf of others.

For example, the `organization` field holds information about the organization processing the data and its representative, be it your organization **or** your organization and the organization(s) on behalf of which you are processing data.

The same logic applies to the `dpo` field, which holds information about your DPO **or** the DPO(s) of the organization(s) on behalf of which you are processing data.

## Selectors

:::tip API

Selectors can be set in the PCE using [PUT /configure/selectors](https://devkit-pce-staging.azurewebsites.net/swagger/#/Configuration/putV0ConfigureSelectors) as detailed in the related `CreateSelectorPayload` schema.

:::

Sensitive data you capture on a regular base can often be complex to categorize.

The blindnet devkit gives you a clear [set of data categories](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/dictionary/data-categories/en.data-categories.json) you can use to qualify collected sensitive data for efficient privacy management.

A selector can be defined as a subcategory of any of these data categories, using [dot notation](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#term-dot-notation), to qualify [any captured data](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#data-capture-fragments).

For example, you can define a `FINANCIAL.BANK-ACCOUNT.IBAN`, as a subcategory of the predefined `FINANCIAL.BANK-ACCOUNT` category, to identify and retrieve an IBAN number collected for regular payment.

<!-- TODO: link to the data capture section instead once it's done -->

_Refer to the definition of [Data Capture Fragments in PRIV](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#data-capture-fragments) for more details._

:::caution

Each selector is defined by its full dot notation (`{data_category}.{subcategory}`).

Using just `{subcategory}` will lead to an error.

`{subcategory}` can however be optional, as any data category can be used as a selector.

:::

## Legal Bases

:::tip API

Legal Bases can be set in the PCE using [PUT /configure/legal-bases](https://devkit-pce-staging.azurewebsites.net/swagger/#/Configuration/putV0ConfigureLegal-bases), retrieved using [GET /configure/legal-bases](https://devkit-pce-staging.azurewebsites.net/swagger/#/Configuration/getV0ConfigureLegal-bases), as detailed in the related `CreateLegalBasePayload` schema.

:::

Both law and your users require any capture of sensitive data and any manipulation of such data to be clearly justified.
In other words, you need to define and expose a legitimate (i.e. **_legal_**) foundation (i.e. **_base_**) before conducting any operation on sensitive data.
You need, at all times, to record and explain why you need to conduct such operations.

The blindnet devkit helps you to easily define such _Legal Bases_ for your whole system.

Thanks to this configuration, all contracts, legitimate interests and necessary legal bases are clearly defined and easily maintained for your whole system in a single place.
This not only allows you to avoid any ambiguity or omission but also to be ready for change at any time.
Legislations, organizations' rules, product features, and any other aspects of data privacy, can indeed change often and quickly.
Such changes can lead to extensive and tedious data manipulations and communications to people from which you collected data.
Thanks to your legal bases configuration, the PCE will greatly ease this process, by recommending and even allowing you to automate related operations.

_Refer to the legal bases [lifecycle](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#lifecycle-of-legal-bases-for-data-processing) and [format](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#legal-base) definition in PRIV for more details._

### Types of Legal bases

As with [selectors](#selectors), _Legal Bases' Types_ can be defined via a dedicated set of [terms](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/dictionary/legal-bases/en.legal-bases.json) you can extend and refine using [dot notation](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#term-dot-notation).

### Privacy Scope of a Legal base

By default, a legal base is defined without any scope. This means it refers to all data, processing and purposes.

However, most legal bases are only bound to specific contexts.
Such contexts can be defined by three aspects:

- _Categories of Processing_: what you intend to do with the data, e.g. `COLLECTING`
- _Data Categories_: what type of data is used during the operation, e.g. `CONTACT`
- _Purpose of Processing_: what type of data is concerned, e.g. `PERSONALIZATION`

:::tip

You can phrase a privacy scope in a sentence of the form:

<p align="center">
  « We <strong>need</strong> <em><code>Processings</code></em> <strong>of/on</strong> <em><code>Data Categories</code></em> <strong>for</strong> <em><code>Purposes</code></em>. »
</p>

:::

Here again, these three parameters can be set using specific sets of terms with dot notation:

- [data categories](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/dictionary/data-categories/en.data-categories.json) (can be extended to include selectors)
- [processing categories](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/dictionary/processing-categories/en.processing-categories.json)
- [purposes of processing](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/dictionary/purposes/en.purposes.json)

## Retention Policies

:::tip API

Retention policies can be set in the PCE using [PUT /configure/retention-policies](https://devkit-pce-staging.azurewebsites.net/swagger/#/Configuration/putV0ConfigureRetention-policies) as detailed in the related `CreateRetentionPolicy` schema.

:::

Retention policies are here to help you track and automate all required operations on sensitive data you hold.

They define how long you can keep each data after a specific event occurs.

:::tip

You can phrase a retention policy in a sentence of the form:

<p align="center">
  « <strong>Keep</strong> <em><code>Data Category</code></em> <strong>for</strong> <em><code>no longer / less than</code></em> <em><code>duration</code></em> <strong>after</strong> <em><code>Event Type</code></em>. »
</p>

:::

You can define a retention policy in the PCE by associating:

- a type of event (`after`), using the associated predefined [set of terms](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/dictionary/events) you can extend using [dot notation](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#term-dot-notation)
- with a certain category of data (`data_category`), using a pre-configured [selector](#selectors)
- for a specific point in time, defined by:
    - a before/after operator (`policy`) called "retention term" (`NO-LONGER-THAN`, `NO-LESS-THAN`, or any of their subcategories defined according to dot notation as defined [in PRIV](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/dictionary/retentions/en.retentions.json))
    - and a `duration` (using the [ISO 8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations))

For example, the following defines contact data shouldn't be kept more than 30 days after the associated service ended:

```json
{
  "data_categoy": "CONTACT",
  "policy": "NO-LONGER-THAN",
  "duration": "P30D",
  "after": "SERVICE-END"
}
```

_Refer to [retention policies](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#retention-policy) in PRIV for more details._

## Provenances

:::tip API

Provenances configuration can be set in the PCE using [PUT /configure/provenances](https://devkit-pce-staging.azurewebsites.net/swagger/#/Configuration/putV0ConfigureProvenances), and is detailed in the related `CreateProvenancePayload` schema.

:::

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Format | Example |
| :----: | :------ |
| [Provenance](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#provenance) | `provenance-category`:`USER.DATA-SUBJECT`, `system`: `id of this system to which the user gives their e-mail address` |

Use [PUT /configure/provenances](https://devkit-pce-staging.azurewebsites.net/swagger/#/Configuration/putV0ConfigureProvenances) to configure provenances for data categories.

Provenance object represents the origin of the data.
