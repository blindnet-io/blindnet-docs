The Privacy Computation Engine (PCE) processes a timeline of [PRIV Events](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#events).

Feed anything that is a PRIV event (e.g. Consent, Legal Base Event, Privacy Request) to your PCE.
The PCE will order them in a timeline.

Processing the timeline of PRIV events, the PCE will deliver recommendations of [Privacy Request Responses](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#privacy-request-response)

The PCE decides on the responses to recommend by calculating, at each moment an Eligible Privacy Scope.
The component responsible for translating PRIV events into operations over the Eligible Privacy Scope is called Privacy Compiler.
