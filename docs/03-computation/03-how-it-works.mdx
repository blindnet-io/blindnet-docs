Based on the configuration you provided, the Privacy Computation Engine creates a set of **Processing Records** that contain:

- Identification of the data field in your database. Table/Object and field/property. E.g. `USER`, `e_mail_address`
- A [Privacy Scope](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#privacy-scope) e.g. (`CONTACT.EMAIL` x {`COLLECTION`, `STORING`, `USING`} x {`SERVICES`,`COMPLIANCE`})
- One or more [Legal Bases](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/RFC-PRIV.md#legal-base) e.g. a legal base of type `CONTRACT`

It is possible to end-up having serval records for one Data Category, e.g.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Data in database | Privacy Scope | Legal bases |
| :----: | :-----: | :--------|
| table:`USER` field:`name` | `NAME.FIRST-NAME` x {`COLLECTION`, `STORING`, `USING`} x {`SERVICES`,`COMPLIANCE`} | `CONTRACT` |
| table:`USER` field:`e_mail_address` | `CONTACT.EMAIL` x {`COLLECTION`, `STORING`, `USING`} x {`SERVICES`,`COMPLIANCE`} | `CONTRACT` |
| table:`USER` field:`e_mail_address` | `CONTACT.EMAIL` x `USING` x {`MARKETING`,`ADVERTISING`} | `LEGITIMATE-INTEREST`|
| table:`USER` field:`e_mail_address` | `CONTACT.EMAIL` x `SHARING` x {`ADVERTISING`} | `CONSENT`|

The records given in the example correspond to the situation of a System that is processing the user's e-mail address for purposes of providing services to the user and for compliance with regulation (KYC) under `CONTRACT` legal base.
The same System is sending marketing and advertising e-mail to the user under `LEGITIMATE-INTEREST` assuming that as long as the user don't not object they might be interested in additional services.
The System only shares the e-mail with partners under `CONSENT` legal base.

A **Transfer Record** has:

- One or more data categories being transferred outside of the system e.g. `CONTACT.EMAIL`
- One or more Systems to which transfer is made (their IDs (URLs) and user-readable names)

Multiple provenance objects can also be provided for the same data category. Consider the following examples:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Provenance object | `data-category` | `provenance-category` | `system` |
| :----: | :-----: | :-----: | :--------|
| provenance1 | `CONTACT.EMAIL` | `USER.DATA-SUBJECT` | `https://thissystem.com` |
| provenance2 | `CONTACT.EMAIL` | `TRANSFERRED` | `https://linkedin.com` |
| provenance2 | `BEHAVIOR.CONNECTION` | `DERIVED` | `https://thissystem.com` |
| provenance3 | `PROFILING` | `TRANSFERRED` | `https://marketing-data-exchange.com` |

The records given in the example correspond to the situation of a System that collect the e-mail directly from the user (proveance1), but also, since the System uses OpenID and allow login through Linkedin, it may gain knowledge of e-mail from Linkedin (provenance2).
The system generates connection data, every time the user connects to it.
It obtains profiling data about the user for a marketing data exchange platform, so that it can better target the user with marketing offers.
