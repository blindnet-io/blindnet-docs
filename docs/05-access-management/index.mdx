# Access Management

## Set Up your Privacy System

<WipWarning callToAction="false">
  <p>The instruction in this section are only here to give you a glips on how the system identification works with the Privacy Computation Engine.</p>
  <p>At this moment, one blindnet devkit install using a single instance of the Privacy Computation Engine <em>is</em> considered as a coherent single system automatically, using an internally generated ID.</p>
  <p>Check out out <a href="/docs/tutorial">introductory tutorial</a> for a concrete and up-to-date overview.</p>
</WipWarning>

In blindnet devkit, all components are identified to be part of a coherent "system" using a "System ID".

System IDs are simple version 4 UUIDs you can create using any compatible generator, like, for example, [uuidgenerator.net](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/).

You then just need to add this UUID to the PCE database with the following:

```sql
insert into apps values ('7427a303-f776-4df4-aaea-41bc64f48f93');
insert into dac values ('7427a303-f776-4df4-aaea-41bc64f48f93', false);
insert into automatic_responses_config values ('7427a303-f776-4df4-aaea-41bc64f48f93', true, true, true, true);
```

## Dashboard

:::warning

The current access management dashboard available on [dashboard.blindnet.io](https://dashboard.blindnet.io) is only provided to support our standalone [encryption libraries](/docs/encryption/).

A new dashboard allowing you to manage all aspects of blindnet devkit applications and users, including encryption, is under development and on restricted access.

[Contact us](https://www.blindnet.io/contact) directly to book a demo and discuss how our new dashboard can fit your specific needs.

:::

The blindnet dashboard is a service and interface engineered to help you accomplish management operations intuitively from a central place.

Futures include (but aren't limited to):

- managing all users and applications via an intuitive interface
- easily generate and manage system IDs
- finely manage access to each component of your system

Following our [Open Core](https://github.com/blindnet-io/openness-framework/blob/main/docs/refs/business-models.md#open-core) model, the blindnet dashboard is delivered as a proprietary paid service.
