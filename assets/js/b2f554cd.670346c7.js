World!","permalink":"/blog/hello-world-blindnetdev"}},"content":"It\'s Summer Time!\\nThe Summer Solstice!\\nThe first day of the season!\\nThe longest day of the year!\\n\\nWe have worked a lot throughout the spring to improve our community experience and working processes.\\nSo we have a lot of stuff to announce to you today.\\n\\nLet\'s see what we\'ll do together during this new season, and all the new cool stuff we realized for that.\\n\\n![Summer Time](/img/blog/summer-glasses.jpg)\\n\\nAt blindnet, all teams recently synchronized their schedule to match summer dates, from June 21st to September 23rd.\\n\\nThis is what we call the ***Summer of Privacy***.\\n\\n## Openly Chilling\\n\\nAs summer is a time for chilling and relaxing, we don\'t want this period to be stressful in any way.\\n\\nAfter all, Summer has always been a time for opening up, and meeting new people.\\n\\nAnd we stand for an Open approach to privacy, where we both give people better control over their data and more access to ours.\\n\\nAn approach we are backing up with our own [Openness Framework](https://github.com/blindnet-io/openness-framework), defining every aspect of our working process.\\n\\nNow, every staff member at blindnet, including sales people and the CEO, are using GitHub to handle every aspect of team work.\\nDoing so, we\'re making sure to share as many pieces of information as possible in the Open, by default.\\n\\nSo, as we have a lot of projects on our plate, we\'ll conduct all of them **with you**, giving you lots of opportunities to contribute.\\n\\n## Building a New DevKit Together\\n\\nFirst, we are currently all working on building an [ambitious new set of features](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/tree/main/refs/high-level-conceptualization) for blindnet devkit.\\nLeading us to a [completely redesigned architecture](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/tree/main/refs/high-level-architecture) and [schematics](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/pull/659).\\n\\nBut we know that we don\'t know everything.\\nAnd we especially want to avoid making wrong assumption about what **you**, the developers, need.\\n\\nWe especially want you to tell us what you\'d expect from such ambitious privacy dev tools.\\n\\nWhat problems are you facing when embracing Privacy-by-Design?\\\\\\nWhat are you worst pain points when enforcing privacy regulations (e.g. GDPR)?\\\\\\nWhat do you need from an app to be sure to sufficiently trust it?\\n\\nHere, we already give you several opportunities to do that:\\n\\n1. our recently opened [Slack Workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/blindnet/shared_invite/zt-1arqlhqt3-A8dPYXLbrnqz1ZKsz6ItOg), to chat with the blindnet community and teams;\\n1. an open [DevRel Management](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management) repository, when you can just [make simple informal requests](https://github.com/blindnet-io/devrel-management/issues/new?assignees=noelmace&labels=request%2Ctriage&template=request.yml&title=%5BRequest%5D%3A+);\\n1. an open [Product Management](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/) repository, where you can track, read, and contribute to all parts of our product development process, from simple bug fixes to thorough architecture reference documents.\\n\\nIf those still seem too complex or frightening to you, just email [hello@blindnet.io](mailto:hello@blindnet.io), and we\'ll make sure to give you an answer right away.\\n\\n## Helping Everyone Better Understand Privacy\\n\\nWhile getting on with this huge project, we\'ll also make sure to keep you posted in any possible way.\\n\\nSo first, you should definitely follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/blindnet_io), as this will be the first place where we\'ll post short and constant updates on all technical matters.\\n\\nOur new engineering blog, on both [blindnet.dev](https://blindnet.dev/blog) and [dev.to](https://dev.to/blindnet), will then be a good place to share more in-depth explainers and update about our devkit and privacy in general.\\nWhere are open to any suggestion of topic to address, and even guest blog posts.\\nSo make sure to contact us whenever privacy inspire you.\\n\\nFinally, we\'ll soon open a new Twitch Channel and Youtube channel, with regular programs and improvised streaming.\\nKeep posted, and reach back to us if you\'d like to be one of our next guests.\\n\\n## And more...\\n\\nAnd we still have a lot more ideas to suggest, and things we\'d like to do with you.\\n\\nLike making the \\"limited edition\\" blindnet swag of your dream, with an open-hardware and DIY approach, just to give you an example.\\n\\nWe\'ll make sure everyone can make the best of this summer with privacy in mind, and we are open to any suggestion.\\n\\nSo, see you all very soon online
